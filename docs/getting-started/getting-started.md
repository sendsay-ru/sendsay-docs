Sendsay is a platform that helps you communicate with clients. Here you can send campaigns, store subscriber data and track statistics. There are five communication channels: email, SMS, web push notifications, Viber and VK. However, you can send emails and messages only to your subscribers.

## Subscribers
Each subscriber has a profile with contacts, personal data, and email campaign reports. There are three ways to add subscribers:
manual import
signup forms
automatic import from your CRM via API

To store subscriber data, you must have consent from your clients. Your client database cannot not be purchased or scraped; it should be your own original database. Our system recognizes bad mailing lists and blocks them (or you will be asked to confirm that your entire database was collected by you).
